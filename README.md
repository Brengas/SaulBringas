Hello, my name is Saul, Bionics engineer and robotics enthusiast passionate about designing and building all kind of intelligent systems. This repository serves as a portfolio to showcase my skills and all the projects I've worked on and hopefully, as inspiration for other students whose goal is to get into the robotics field.
